The following is an example for how to add a new source to the scraper: 

{
    "name": "What name do you want to appear in the UI for this source?",
    "url": "The central hub where all the press releases are posted",
    "base_url": "the above url before any forward slashes",
    "regex": "matching pattern. needs to contain 'title' and 'link' capture group"
}

Also, make sure you save it as a json file!
